                        Boost is a mechanic that allows players to increase their speed when moving forward or enables them to fly for a short amount of time. It can also be used as a breaking assist or to change momentum. Boost only accelerates in the direction the car is facing, so achieving supersonic speed while driving in reverse is only possible through collisions or dodging.
                        <br><br>
                        There are two kinds of boost pads: 100% refills, which appear as floating orbs, and 12% refills. The former are normally located at the corners and edges of arenas, whereas the smaller ones are placed more inwardly.

                        A demolition only occurs when a player bumps another player at supersonic speed. The victim of a demolition will explode and combust, but will respawn near their team's goal after a 3 seconds. The word "BOOM!" appears in the explosion once the enemy player is destroyed. If two players run into each other, both at supersonic speed, and their fenders collide, they will both be demolished.
                        <br><br>
                        No scoreboard points are awarded for demolitions, but if a player performs 7 demolitions in a match, they will receive twenty points and "Extermination points icon Extermination" will appear on their screen. In higher-level gameplay, demolitions are sometimes used tactically to prevent an opponent from scoring, or to clear the way for a teammate to score.

                        In Rocket League, an aerial refers to a maneuver performed by a player's car while it is airborne, often involving jumping and boosting to reach and interact with the ball in mid-air. Aerials are an essential skill in the game and can greatly impact gameplay and scoring opportunities. Executing an aerial requires good timing, spatial awareness, and control over your car's movement.
                        <br><br>
                        Mastering aerials in Rocket League takes practice, as it involves precise timing, spatial awareness, and understanding the physics of the game. With experience, you can develop the ability to perform aerials consistently, opening up new possibilities for offensive plays, defensive clears, and overall gameplay creativity.

                        The Rocket League Championship Series, also known as the RLCS, is the Psyonix funded Rocket League league. The competition began in Spring 2016 with its inaugural season giving an opportunity for the top North American and European teams to fight for their share of the $75,000 USD prize pool. The first World Championship was hosted in Los Angeles, California, with its reappearance during the Season 3 World Championship, between the first Finals taking place in Europe, held in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
                        <br><br>
                        Season 3 of the RLCS introduced the 3rd region to join the league, Oceania. This therefore extended the number of spots for the World Championship from 8 teams to 10. The Oceania region League Play is managed by Throwdown Esports.

                        At the advent of Season 5 in June 2018, Psyonix organised and managed the event alone. Previous to this, they partnered with Twitch. Season 6 started in September 2018 and featured a $1,000,000 prize pool. For Season 7, Psyonix introduced South America as a new region. Season 8 took place in December 2019.The Season 9 championship was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with winners of the regional championships being considered the champions. In July 2020, Psyonix announced a new format for the tenth season of RLCS, known as RLCS X. This format did away with league play and the RLRS in favor of teams earning points through three regional splits, all culminating in three seasonal majors.
